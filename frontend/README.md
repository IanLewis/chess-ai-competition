The Frontend Service
=======================

The frontend service makes use of backend services and shows information to the
user. This is the part that is a more traditional web app.

# Architecture

The frontend is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and uses
require.js ([AMD](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html)) for defining modules.

# Getting Started

Here's what you need to do to get the frontend running.

## Install Node.js

You'll need node.js to run the frontend app. Download it from
http://nodejs.org/

## Install Dependencies

Node.js comes with the Node Package Manager (npm). Install the dependencies for
the frontend using npm. The dependencies are defined in
[package.json](package.json) so you just need to run:

    $ npm install

## Run the dev server
